# Mini-Stereo-Digital-Audio-Processor-MSDAP
This is a project of ASIC. MSDAP is a low-cost, low-power and application specific mini stereo digital audio processor used in a hearing aid. The main function of this processor is a two-channel, 256 order, finite impulse response (FIR) digital filter. It receives 16 bits voice data(sampled at 50 kHz) and computes the FIR result at the speed of 25.MHz.
